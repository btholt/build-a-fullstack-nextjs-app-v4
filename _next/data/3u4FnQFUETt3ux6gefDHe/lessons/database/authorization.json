Authentication is logging in, logging out, and signing up. It's you handshaking to the service \"this is who I am\" via social login, username-and-password, etc. Authentication answers the question **who is it**? Authorization is taking your identity and asking the question **what are you allowed to do?** I can be logged in to Facebook but I can't see everyone's DMs. Why? Because I am not authorized to do so. However you are authorized to see your own DMs. And possibly the admins / moderators of Facebook can see them too, because they may be authorized to see _anyone_'s DMs.\n\nWe already did authentication when we implemented Stack Auth. But we haven't done anything with authorization. We just said \"if you're logged in you're authorized to do anything\". Let's go make it so you can only edit your own posts.\n\n> You'll see authZ and authN everywhere. Generally speaking when people write \"Auth\" they mean either just authN or both authZ and authN.\n\nGo to the db folder and create a file called authz.ts and put this in there\n\n```typescript\nimport { eq } from \"drizzle-orm\";\nimport db from \"@/db/index\";\nimport { articles } from \"@/db/schema\";\n\nexport const authorizeUserToEditArticle = async function authorizeArticle(\n  loggedInUserId: string,\n  articleId: number\n): Promise<boolean> {\n  const response = await db\n    .select({\n      authorId: articles.authorId,\n    })\n    .from(articles)\n    .where(eq(articles.id, articleId));\n\n  if (!response.length) {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  return response[0].authorId === loggedInUserId;\n};\n```\n\nThis takes in an article ID and a user ID and returns if they are able to edit that article or not.
