{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{},"html":"<p>We are going to get started writing to our database using Drizzle. Drizzle is a phenomenal ORM, which stands for object-relational mapping. In reality it just means a it&#39;s a software package where you define the shape of your data, and it takes care of managing and querying the database for you. Instead of writing raw SQL statements, you write code that then gets translated into SQL for you.</p>\n<p>In the past I did not recommend using an ORM (I think you can find this in my previous Frontend Masters courses!) Why not? I had some pretty bad experiences over the year using ORMs in the earlier days of my career (mostly in PHP and Java.) I&#39;d start using an ORM and it would be amazing: it made it easy to get started, to do basic selects and inserts, and the general 95% use case (and I&#39;ll say generally speaking, writing this sort of SQL is not hard.) The problem came when you needed to do more advanced querying that the designers of the ORM didn&#39;t anticipate. All the sudden what was helping you work faster was a huge impedance on you doing what you want to do. You&#39;re suddenly fighting the framework instead of being helped by it. This happened frequently enough that I decided I&#39;d rather just write SQL, and I did that for most of my career (I also like SQL, but it took a lot of practice for me to say that.)</p>\n<p>So why now? Why do I like Drizzle instead of choosing to just to continue to do raw SQL?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Its design is very SQL-ish. A lot of other ORMs try to hide SQL from you and in the process make it hard when you need to do SQL-ish things. that&#39;s probably my biggest complaint about other ORMs and I <em>don&#39;t</em> have that about Drizzle.</li>\n<li>TypeScript support, and that&#39;s the biggest reason <em>to</em> use Drizzle. When you describe something in Drizzle, all the sudden you have amazing TypeScript support for all your database queries. Otherwise you&#39;d be stuck writing all these types yourself and with Drizzle you just don&#39;t have to.</li>\n<li>They even go one step further and they make little packages for each database provider. For Neon, we have all the Neon Auth tables built into the Drizzle package so you don&#39;t need to write those types; they&#39;re just built into Drizzle. So cool!</li>\n<li>The OSS team is also super nice and helpful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So let&#39;s get started!

So creating migrations, running migrations, etc.</li>\n<li>We could use the normal pg and postgres.js packages, and in many cases you might want to. These use TCP for their connections and support connection pooling that leave connections open which means lower-latency and generally faster connections. However initial connections for these sorts of packages take a while and really aren&#39;t a good fit for things like serverless environments where connections will be spinning up and spinning down frequently.</li>\n<li>We&#39;re going to use the Neon serverless driver. This allows us to do SQL over either HTTP or WebSockets (and we&#39;re going to do HTTP.)

Feel free to read these (I like Drizzle because these are usually pretty readable) but never, ever, ever modify these by hands. You are setting yourself up for major issues if you do because Drizzle assumes it does all of these and will not respect any handcrafted code you chuck in here.\n\n> Note that this creates the migrations but does not apply them. Your Neon database will still be empty until you run migrate.\n\nNow let's run it.\n\n```bash\nnpx drizzle-kit migrate\n```\n\nThis applies what we made with generate. And now you can see the empty tables in Neon. Pretty cool, right!?\n\n> You can also run `npx drizzle-kit push` to just yolo apply whatever schema you have at the moment. This is nice when you're making changes and you just want to apply the new schema and aren't ready to codify what you have as code.\n\nI wrote a little seed script for you to have some database. **Note: you must have at least one user signed up via Neon Auth or this does not work**. Either sign up via your website or add one manually via the Neon console.\n\n[Copy and paste all of this code][seed] into db/seed.ts.\n\nLet's make all of these npm scripts.\n\n```json\n// the end of your scripts in your package.json\n\"db:seed\": \"tsx src/db/seed.ts\",\n\"db:generate\": \"drizzle-kit generate\",\n\"db:migrate\": \"drizzle-kit migrate\"\n```\n\nWe'll need tsx for this as well (run TypeScript files as Node, just makes it easy) so run `npm i -D tsx`\n\nSo feel free to run `npm run db:seed` now and you should have five articles in your database now to play with.\n\nAwesome. Let's go _use_ these now.\n\n[seed]: https://github.com/btholt/fullstack-next-wiki/tree/main/04-database/src/db/seed.ts\n","slug":"setting-up-drizzle","title":"Setting up Drizzle","section":"Database","icon":"database","filePath":"/home/runner/work/build-a-fullstack-nextjs-app-v4/build-a-fullstack-nextjs-app-v4/lessons/04-database/B-setting-up-drizzle.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/database/query-with-drizzle","prevSlug":"/lessons/database/neon-and-postgres"}},"__N_SSG":true}
