Remix is definitely carving its own niche and merits a glance. The non-React ones are amazing too: SvelteKit, SolidStart, Nuxt, any of them. I&#39;d endorse you building with any one of those. You should go take a look and see what they excel at and what they&#39;re not great at. For example, if I was rebuilding my course builder, I&#39;d probably strongly consider Astro and it&#39;s more built for this use-case: heavy content websites. If you don&#39;t want to or don&#39;t need to use React Server Components, TanStack Start is a perfect place to land.
