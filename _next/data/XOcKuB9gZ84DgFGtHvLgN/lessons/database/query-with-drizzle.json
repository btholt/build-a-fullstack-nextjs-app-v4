Our app is already pulling dummy data via a server helper function, so this makes it pretty simple as we only need to update this server helper as opposed to doing it in the code (and makes it super testable!)\n\nLet's open src/lib/data/articles.ts.\n\n```typescript\n// replace everything but the getArticlesById function - we'll do that in a sec\nimport db from \"@/db/index\";\nimport { articles } from \"@/db/schema\";\nimport { eq } from \"drizzle-orm\";\nimport { usersSync } from \"drizzle-orm/neon\";\n\nexport async function getArticles() {\n  const response = await db\n    .select({\n      title: articles.title,\n      id: articles.id,\n      createdAt: articles.createdAt,\n      content: articles.content,\n      author: usersSync.name,\n    })\n    .from(articles)\n    .leftJoin(usersSync, eq(articles.authorId, usersSync.id));\n  return response;\n}\n```\n\n- We're first importing our db client. This is what will actually connect to the database.\n- We then import the articles schema. Why? This is how you reference which table you want to query. We want the articles table, so we import that schema.\n- In the function, we run a select, choose what columns we want, tell it which table it's coming from, and then join in the author's name (because we want to say the article was written by Bob, not \"user-12334\")\n- We added the where clause and used `eq` which, as you may imagine, checks for equality. Here we're saying we want to do the join on where the authorId in the article table is the same as the usersSync id so we can get a name instead of an ID.\n- And then we return the array of rows!
