You did it!!

This was a fun course to write and teach, I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you walked away not necessarily attached to our Vercel/Neon/Upstash/etc. stack, but informed of what pieces fit where and the confidence to go forward and make your own trade-offs. I hope this reads less like an ad for those services (particularly Neon lol) and more like an exploration of a specific stack. Go back and try to make this with Cloudflare/Railway/OpenRouter/Clerk/etc. and see what you like better and what you like less.

In any case, please keep building and sharing - it's what makes this community fun. And I'll catch you on the next Frontend Masters!
