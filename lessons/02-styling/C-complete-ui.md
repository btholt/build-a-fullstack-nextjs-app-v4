title: "Complete UI"
---

This isn't a UI course, so we're going to instantiate the rest of the UI right now and we'll spend the rest of time putting all the backend pieces together and modifying the UI to use them. We just finished the 01-shadcn checkpoint, please start now from the [02-complete-ui][checkpoint] step. This has the same stuff we just built - I just went ahead and "finished" the rest of the site for you. Once you've `npm install`ed and gotten the dev service running, please to the next step.

> 🏁 This is the [02-complete-ui][checkpoint] checkpoint. Open that folder in the sample project repo to go to where we are as of right here.
